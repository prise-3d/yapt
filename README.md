Yet another path tracer. Heavily inspired by Peter Shirley's Ray tracing in one weekend. Will probably diverge substantially from Shirley's work as new features are implemented.

### Requirements:
- Libtorch 2.8.0+cpu installed in /opt/libtorch
- Intel MKL 2025.2.0 installed in /opt/intel/oneapi/mkl/2025.2
